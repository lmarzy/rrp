    quote: "The RRP RearGuard could be the perfect product for you, doing a good job of keeping your rear end protected from wheelspray. Unlike the Ass Saver, the RRP RearGuard has the added security of a Velcro strap, which means that you don't get back at the end of a ride to discover that your mini-mudguard has fallen off mid-ride (something that I've experienced a number of times with the Ass Saver. As an added bonus it is seriously cheap. Surely £8.99 is a price worth paying for a dry bum this winter",
