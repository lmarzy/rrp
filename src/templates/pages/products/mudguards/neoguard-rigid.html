      step: "Wrap the 2 velcro straps at the top of the NeoGuard RIGID over and then under the lower crown and pull back through the eyelets in the guard, only loosely attach them for now, this will help keep the guard out of the way whilst you attach the bottom straps",

  {
    quote: "It stops spray from hitting you in the face which is a godsend when your racing. The best bit is when the fork compresses, it scrunches up the guard and loosens the mud. It's also lightweight and can go in the wash, a new an innovative take on mud protection",

  {
    quote: "RRP's NeoGuard - Product of the year? How does it fit? dead easy it took me about 30 seconds, it took longer to get out of the packet. 5 hoop and loop straps hold it tight to the lower crown and the fork brace on the sliders... then ride, get it dirty and then chuck it in the washing machine with the rest of your kit. Genius!!",

  {
    quote: "Rapid Racer launch new mudguard. Rapid Racer Products has launched a new mudguard thatâ€™s lightweight, which doubles up as an advertising banner for any company / brand or race team. The neoprene guard sheds clingy mud with compression of the suspension, thus staying light due to very little dirt retention.",

  {
    quote: "The NeoGuard works perfectly. The rapid racing crew run a tight ship on the race circuit and saw the need for a professional product to replace the pikey tube fix. Fitting takes a few seconds, we checked everyones goggles after a recent spray-ridden run at Cwmcarn and the unsurprising result is the NeoGuard fender' is a success, keeping goggles mostly splatter free as intended. It's a very well executed solution, looks the part, and is a carefully developed product.",
