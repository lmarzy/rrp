productOverview: [
  "The ProGuard is an amazing front mudguard for mountain bikes offering unmatched protection from mud and spray, it’s perfect for Enduro or Downhill racers and essential for the weekend warrior looking for the very best protection. Our design intent was to increase the tyre clearance, improve fit, and reduce the mud clogging issues seen with this type of mudguard. The STANDARD offers superb protection in a shorter more compact design, whereas the longer MAX PROTECTION version (21mm longer at front and 68mm longer at the rear) offers incredible levels of protection especially for high speed racing."

      step: Slide the guard into position with the wheel in, you may need to squeeze the sides of the guard as you do so to get it through the fork brace
    },
    {
      step: Hold the guard in position making sure it tracks the tyres equally both ends
    },
    {
      step: You can now see which holes you need for the most secure fit to your fork brace
    },
    {
      step: Remove guard and push out / snap-off these holes, then feed zip ties through the same holes (from front to rear) plus 2 sets on the arms (total 6 zip ties),
