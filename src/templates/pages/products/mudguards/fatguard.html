      step: "LOOSELY attach the bottom zip ties around the fork leg, then push up and angle the guard so you can see which snap-off holes on the top you need to pop out (NB: There are holes in the centre for those with holes in the top of their fork)"

    {
      step: Carefully pop out the holes with a pen or screw driver and slide through the zip ties

      step: You can rotate / twist the bottom arms around the legs to raise/lower the back of the guard (ensure the guard doesn't hit the frame when bottoming the fork)

      step: Tighten all zip ties TIGHT and cut off any excess
    },

      step: It is important to check the guard doesn't strike the frame when turning the bars or when bottoming the fork if you are using a suspension fork,
