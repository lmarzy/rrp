            <p>The ProGuard BOLT ON will fit most fork models listed below if they have the *THREADED HOLES at the rear of the fork brace (you will also need 18mm MIN of tyre clearance to fit)</p>

                IMPORTANT: You must apply the rubber adhesive side pads to the recess on the mudguard side wings, they protect your fork legs and provide vital stability and resonance damping<span>

                Squeeze the side wings of the mudguard hard and slide under the fork brace from the rear with the wheel and tyre still in place
              </li>
              <li class="c-fitting__item">You should be able to locate the mudguard and let go as the rubber side pads should hold it in place (ensure the slots are centrally aligned to the threaded holes on your fork)</li>
              <li class="c-fitting__item">Use the Allen key provided to screw the bolts in EVENLY a bit each side, go gentle to start off to ensure you DON'T CROSS THREAD THEM, stop once it's pulled together so you can still move it</li>
              <li class="c-fitting__item">Check alignment of the mudguard to ensure the distance from the tyre is even front and back, if you need to adjust the alignment then remove the mudguard and clip-on the appropriate TILT BRACKET found in the packaging (see fig a example below).  There are 2 TILT BRACKETS, one raises the front of the mudguard up and the other lowers it down (written on the TILT BRACKET)</li>
              <li class="c-fitting__item">You can also change the height of the mudguard by 6mm through the slots for more clearance. NOTE: Highest position offers the most stability with the best mud clearance<li>
              <li class="c-fitting__item">
                <p class="u-mb05">Finally tighten the bolts to the torque settings below:</p>

            <p>NOTE: ONLY USE THE RRP SUPPLIED BOLTS AS THESE ARE SPECIFICALLY SELECTED OR DESIGNED FOR THE MUDGUARD - USING OTHER BOLTS MAY INVALIDATE WARRANTY - REPLACEMENT BOLTS PACKS ARE AVAILIBLE</p>

            <p class="u-col-a">IMPORTANT - YOU MUST CHECK BOTTOM OUT CLEARANCE LET MOST (BUT NOT ALL) OF THE AIR OUT OF YOUR FORK AND COMPRESS TO TEST IF THE CROWN OF THE FORK HITS THE MUDGUARD WHEN BOTTOMING.  LOWER THE MUDGUARD THROUGH THE SLOTS IF YOU NEED MORE CLEARANCE, IF YOU CAN'T LOWER FURTHER THEN DO NOT USE</p>
